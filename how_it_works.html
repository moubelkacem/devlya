    <h2>Neyovo-Togesu | How it works?</h2>
    <p>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
Imagine a platform where people can come together to help each other,
especially those who are in urgent need of support.
This is exactly what our voting system App is all about:
a way to connect those who need help with those who are willing to make a difference.
Whether through a one-time donation or a recurring contribution, every little bit helps, and your generosity will surelly make a big difference!
 </p>
<h3>How It Works?:</h3>
<ul>
      <li><strong>For Those in Need:</strong> Download the app and create a profile explaining your situation.</li>
      <li>Share your profile on social media to gather votes and gain visibility.</li>
      <li>Encourage your supporters to vote for you through the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Voting System</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Votes are tracked in real-time, ensuring fairness and transparency.</li>
     <li>The profile with the most votes at the end of the voting period wins.</li>
     <li>The system highlights the winner's profile on the app for others to support.</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Support Beyond Voting</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Once a winner is selected, their profile is featured on the app.</li>
     <li>Users can send money directly to the winner â€” <span class="highlight">every penny goes to the person in need</span>.</li>
   </ul>
