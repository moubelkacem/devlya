    <h2>Safety tips</h2>
        <p>Each year thousands of people meet their partners online and have a trouble-free dating experience. Please take the time to read through our Safety tips to ensure that your experience is safe and rewarding.</p>
        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>Our App allows you to remain anonymous to other users until you feel ready to provide more informations when you chat with them.</p>
<p>Our App doesnt include your personal contact information in your profile, especially telephone number, email, home address. </p>
<p>Only provide your contact information to someone you can trust.</p>

        <h2>Avoiding problems</h2>
        <p>Ask a lot of questions when communicating and be alert for inconsistencies or requests for money. Make notes if you are suspicious of anything. </p>
<p>If you are suspicious of a person or if someone asks you for money, use common sense and then report the situation to us by using the "Report Abuse" icon located on the member's profile or by using our email. </p>
<p>We do not validate the identity of our members or the information that they submit on their profiles. Although we take steps to eliminate any suspect members, it is not possible to be 100% sure that all members will be honest and truthful in their dealings with other members. Be alert and use common sense when communicating with other members. </p>
<p><strong>NEVER send money to anyone who you met online, but have not yet met in person</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Before you meet</h2>
        <p>Find out as much as possible about the person you are communicating with before you meet them in person. Communicate extensively using email, instant messaging or chat prior to calling the other person. Do not disclose your phone number or personal contact information until you feel comfortable to do so. </p>
<p>Try to request multiple photos of the person you are communicating with. Ask to see photos of the person in a variety of situations at different times in their life. This helps to 'paint a picture' of the person and can be useful to understand more about that person. </p>
<p>When you do decide to meet face to face, pick a public place and tell a friend where you're going, or ask someone you trust to go with you.
</p><p>Let them know when you return from the date.</p>


        <h2>While dating</h2>
        <p>Take your time to get to know the person. Proceed one step at a time and at your own pace.</p>
<p>If dating a person located in a foreign country be aware of cultural differences and take the time to learn the culture and understand the other persons expectations about the relationship. Spend as much time together as is possible getting to know the person, don't just rely on email and instant messaging.</p>
<p><strong> Investing additional time to get to know the person before things get serious will help you to avoid costly mistakes.</strong></p>


        <h2>Before you become engaged</h2>
        <p>Before you get engaged, take the time to consider what could go wrong and know your rights. </p>
<p>Getting married is one of the most important decisions in your life and not something that should be rushed. </p>
<p> Make sure that you know as much as possible about your partner before getting engaged. </p>
<p>Get to know your partner's friends and family: in some countries when you marry someone you also "marry" their family.</p>
<p>If you are getting engaged to someone from another country then you should take additional steps to familiarize yourself with your rights regarding domestic violence, abuse and divorce in your partner's country.</p>
